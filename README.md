# SpotifyThingy; control your music through Minecraft

Here's a cool little preview :)<br>

<br>Although...
+ This plugin isn't production ready, probably won't ever be:
+ Spotify's API is incredibely unreliable, quirky and sucks ass,
+ This also supposedly breaks Spotify's developer TOS, because "hobby projects" *aren't allowed*

<br>TL;DR...
+ Cool concept; bad code, and near impossible thanks to Spotify :)<br>
+ I'm likely not gonna be continuing with this project lol.
